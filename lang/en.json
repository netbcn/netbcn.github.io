    "mission_description": "NetBCN is the local community for Internet techies in and around Barcelona. Established at the beginning of 2019, it is the evolution of the original SDN and Network Programmability MeetUp which we started in 2016. We embrace a wide set of topics related to Internet, Networking and Software and discuss them with an innovative after-work format, either online or in-person.<br>We are interested in all the broad range of technologies and use-cases that are flourishing and are related to networking, from low-level ASIC programming to application level innovations; we also welcome social, economical and political topics revolving around Internet and the city of Barcelona and Catalunya. We organise events with a changing format: a workshop or a tutorial on popular or emerging technologies, a panel of experts sharing tips to advance your career, a couple of presentations or simply letâ€™s chill together over craft beers in an informal way.<br>The main goal of the community is to promote sharing of experience and knowledge among us and to intercept abroad experts that are visiting our beautiful city and would like to share their time with us.<br>Be tuned as new events are coming (using the same MeetUp platform as before to handle registration).",
