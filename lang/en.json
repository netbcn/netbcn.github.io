    "mission_description": "After 3 years of setting up a local community of Internet techies in Barcelona, around the SDN and Network Programmability MeetUp, we are now expanding scope to embrace a wider set of topics related to Internet, Networking and Software. To reinforce the scope change, we are also rebranding the name of the group, as NetBCN.<br>This open group is not a substitute of the traditional Internet Network Operators Group (ie. ESNOG) as we are interested in all the broad range of technologies and use-cases that are flourishing and are related to networking, from low-level ASIC programming to application level innovations.<br>We will organise after-work events with a changing format: a workshop or a tutorial on popular or emerging technologies, a panel of experts sharing tips to advance your career, a couple of presentations or simply letâ€™s chill together over craft beers in an informal way.<br>The main goal of the community is to promote sharing of experience and knowledge among us and to intercept abroad experts that are visiting our beautiful city and would like to share their time with us.<br>Be tuned as new events are coming (using the same MeetUp platform as before to handle registration).<br>BCN SDN meetup is dead, long life NetBCN!",
